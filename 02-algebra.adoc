== Algebraic Expressions

=== Objectives

- Use correct algebraic notation
- Write and simplify expressions

=== Key Point

A *term* is a number, a letter, or a number and a letter multiplied together.

*Like terms* contain the same letter to the same power (or do not contain a letter). You can simplify an expression by collecting like terms.

[cols="^1,^1,^1,<8,^4"]
[grid=none]
|===

|3x|7x| |These are '`like terms`' as the *letters* are the same.

|3x|7y|2x^2^|These are not '`like terms`' as the letters are different or the powers are different.
|===

=== Example
.Simplify by collecting like terms:
====
stem:[2a + 3 + a + 4]:: stem:[ = 3a + 7]
====
.Simplify by collecting like terms:
====
stem:[2x^2 - 2x + 7x^2 + 4x]:: stem:[ = 9x^2 + 2x]
====

=== Questions

. Simplify by collecting like terms
.. stem:[2y + 4 + 7y + 8]
.. stem:[3a + 6b - a - 9b]
.. stem:[8m^2 + 5 - 7m^2 - 3]
.. stem:[r^2 + 6r + 8r^2 - 5r]

. Sam and Ben simplify stem:[4a + 7b - a]. +
  Sam's answer: stem:[5a + 7b] +
  Ben's answer: stem:[3a + 7b]
.. Who is correct? 
.. What mistake did the other student make?

.. Add these terms together, moving clockwise round the set. +
.. Now add the terms together moving __anti__clockwise. Do you get the same result? Does it matter what order you add them in?

=== Key Point
====
Terms can be simplified when multiplying or dividing, even when they are not like terms.

======
stem:[a xx b = ab]

stem:[x -: y = x/y]
======

When multipliying

- write letters in alphabetical order
- write numbers before letters
====

=== Example 2

Simplify

. stem:[6 XX y]
. stem:[5 XX 2p]
. stem:[c XX b]
. stem:[t :- 5]

====
.Answers

. stem:[6y]
. stem:[10p]
. stem:[cb]
. stem:[t/5]

====

=== Questions 2

. Simplify
.. stem:[3 xx m]
.. stem:[c xx 40]
.. stem:[4t xx 2]
.. stem:[d xx c]
.. stem:[h :- 3]
.. stem:[a :- b]

. Exam Style Question
.. Simplify stem:[f + f + f - f]
.. Simplify stem:[2m xx 3]
.. Simplify stem:[3a + 3h + a + 3h]

=== Key Point 3

You write an algebraic expression by using letters to stand for numbers. The letter is called a *variable* because its value can change or *vary*.

=== Questions 3

. Write an expression for these.
.. 6 more than stem:[x]
.. 7 less than stem:[x]
.. 12 multiplied by stem:[y]
.. 3 lots of stem:[m]
.. stem:[y] divided by 2
.. d halved

. *Reasoning* +
  Avinash is stem:[y] years old.
.. His brother is 2 years older. Write an expression in _y_ for Avinash's brother's age.
.. His grandmother is 5 times as old as Avinash. Write an expression in _y_ for Avinash's grandmother's age.
.. His cousin is 3 years older. Write an expression in _y_ for Avinash's cousin's age.
.. Write and simplify an expression for the combined ages of all four.

. Each bag holds _n_ sweets. Write an expression for the number of sweets in +
  image:2-1-sweets.svg[bag of sweets]
.. 2 bags
.. 4 bags
.. 10 bags
.. stem:[x] bags
