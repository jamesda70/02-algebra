== Algebraic Expressions

=== Objectives

- Use correct algebraic notation
- Write and simplify expressions

=== Key Point

A *term* is a number, a letter, or a number and a letter multiplied together.

*Like terms* contain the same letter to the same power (or do not contain a letter). You can simplify an expression by collecting like terms.

[cols="^1,^1,^1,<8,^4"]
[grid=none]
|===

|3x|7x| |These are '`like terms`' as the *letters* are the same.

|3x|7y|2x^2^|These are not '`like terms`' as the letters are different or the powers are different.
|===

=== Example
.Simplify by collecting like terms:
====
stem:[2a + 3 + a + 4]:: stem:[ = 3a + 7]
====
.Simplify by collecting like terms:
====
stem:[2x^2 - 2x + 7x^2 + 4x]:: stem:[ = 9x^2 + 2x]
====

=== Questions

. Simplify by collecting like terms
.. stem:[2y + 4 + 7y + 8]
.. stem:[3a + 6b - a - 9b]
.. stem:[8m^2 + 5 - 7m^2 - 3]
.. stem:[r^2 + 6r + 8r^2 - 5r]

. Sam and Ben simplify stem:[4a + 7b - a]. +
  Sam's answer: stem:[5a + 7b] +
  Ben's answer: stem:[3a + 7b]
.. Who is correct? 
.. What mistake did the other student make?

. image:2-1-q3.svg[]
.. Add these terms together, moving clockwise round the set. +
.. Now add the terms together moving __anti__clockwise. Do you get the same result? Does it matter what order you add them in?

=== Key Point
====
Terms can be simplified when multiplying or dividing, even when they are not like terms.

======
stem:[a xx b = ab]

stem:[x -: y = x/y]
======

When multipliying

- write letters in alphabetical order
- write numbers before letters
====
